# The NekoMimi++ Headers  
This is a C++ variant of my Python library but.. well.. C++-fied  
Contains many useful features not found in the standard C++ libraries such as type converters, conditional checks, wrappers and more useful tools  

# Installation  
uhh.. how do I professionally do this lol  
maybe just copy the header folder to the shared library path, i'll look into this later
